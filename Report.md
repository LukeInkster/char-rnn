# Learning to Debate

This report covers a project undertaken as part of COMP 421 - Machine Learning. The project involved the use of character wise recurrent neural networks. This project makes use of 

#### Collecting Data
The debate data for this project takes the form of text file transcripts collected from a couple of sources. The 2008 and 2012 presidential debates each consisted of four debates which were sourced, in text form, from the [Commission on Presidential Debates](http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=debate-transcripts). At the time of writing, the Commission has not made transcripts available for 2016's presidential debates. Conveniently, the Washington Post has created transcripts for the [first](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/26/the-first-trump-clinton-presidential-debate-transcript-annotated/), [second](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/09/everything-that-was-said-at-the-second-donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-debate-highlighted/), and [third](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/19/the-final-trump-clinton-debate-transcript-annotated/) debates of the 2016 election in a format which matches those from the Commission. When concatenated, the transcripts for these 11 debates amount to 1.2MB of data. The Shakespeare dataset provided by Karpathy for testing is 1.0MB so this debate dataset should be sufficient.

ROMEO:
Talking about thy king and thy castle;
But my kinsman's inform and so in our master.

HERMIONE:
Thou gave before you, man; let's govern'd my life,
Give you more resord his day's graps. And more

Biddleam castle thempens! Pray, and not County lie.
Thus shall not better'd if you call what I know
The dust shut a piteous important,
Lest thou ignoring a color knee she:
It was lost for his and any migrak.

Lord:

What is my chair as we have members. Less

Culling you, for deaths!
